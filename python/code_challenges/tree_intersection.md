## Approach & Efficiency
I am still struggling on the problem. I have and understanding of the concept on how the function should work,
but I haven't fully finished understanding the code fully on the hash part.

## Solution
I believe there is something wrong with the way I implemented the hashtable in hashtable.py. So I will need to fix that
before I can get the last test to pass.
