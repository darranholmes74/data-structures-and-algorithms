## Code
[LinkedList](code_challenges/linked_list_zip.py)

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach for this code was to add the value of each node of both linkedlist to a str and conjugated
that string adding the different symbols as needed.

## Solution
The first two tests passed without much issue, but I took some more time to get the rest passing becuase
I needed more conditional while loops to test for all the cases.
