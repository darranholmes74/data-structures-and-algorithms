# Challenge Title
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

## WhiteBoard

## Code
[tree fizz buzz](../code_challenges/tree_fizz_buzz.py)

## Approach & Efficiency
I first found out a way to check if the value was dividable by 3 or 5 then I had to get the node to change based the checks.


## Solution
I ended up having to use the deepcopy method in order to return a new tree.
