# Code Challenge 2
create a function called insertShiftArray

## Whiteboard Process
![Insert Shift Array](data_structures/assets/insertShift.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
We had an idea about how to create the function from the start however we used chatgpt to refresh our memory on how you use ":" to split arrays.

## Solution
You assign a number to val to have the function add that number into the array. The function will divide the array by 2 creating to array slit in half by index. Then the function adds the split arrays back together with the new number value in the middle. It then returns the new array.
