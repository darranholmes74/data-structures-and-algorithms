## Approach & Efficiency

We used our knowledge of JavaScript to work out our problmes domain and algoritim, then thought about the test cases and edge cases. We then utilized Chatgpt and W3Schools to work out how the code should be written.

## Solution

Given a list of numbers the function reverses the order and returns a new list. We tested this on replit.
