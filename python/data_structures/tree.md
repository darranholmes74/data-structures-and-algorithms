# Challenge Title
Binary Tree and BST Implementation

## Approach & Efficiency
Learning how the walk function worked helped me solve the contains function much easier. I would like to refactor my add function to use the walk function as well.

## Solution
Comparing the value to the root and using the walk function to iterate through from left to right.
