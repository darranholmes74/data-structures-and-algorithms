# Code Challenge 10
create a function called insertShiftArray


## Approach & Efficiency
My approach to this challenge was to start with stacks to understand how they are implemented first to help me better understand queues. I passed one test at a time until all were passing.

## Solution
The way you run my code is with pytest tests/data_structures/stack.py or queue.py. All tests should pass.
