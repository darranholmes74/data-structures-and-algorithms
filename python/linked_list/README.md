# Code Challenge: Class 05: Linked List Implementation
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.


## Approach & Efficiency
My approach for this was to try and understand how node works in general. I took it one step at a time pass each test after the next.
As the test passed I understood a little more each time.

## Solution
python3 linked_list.py
pytest test_linked_list.py
